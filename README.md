## Description
 Giphy is something interested and used worldwide on so things for example (texting, instgram.....so on) becuse of that I decide to 
 create an app for user to retrieve a list of Giphy as following:
- It has a search field and a search button for searching for any items or actors name to search over in a Giphy-list 
- It displays a list of giphy returned by the search api call.  At least the item/element has to be visible 
- we are using 3 files(index.html, script.js and style.css)
